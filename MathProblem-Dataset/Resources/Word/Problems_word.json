Problem4.1 : Write and graph the linear equation described by the following statement: Jenna works at a retail shop. She makes $10 per hour, plus $3 for each item she sells.
Problem Analysis: This problem comes from online, its topic is Line Slope, its difficulty level is basic, its word verbalized level can be categorized as a deep word problem. However, in comparison to Problem3.1, this problems give a hint to translate verbalized natural language toward the math model. It is the student-produced response problem.

Problem 4.2: The amount of money that farmers in Massachusetts paid to maintain their crops
between 1991 and 2008 is modeled by the equation P=3.53t+100, where P is the amount of
money the farmers paid, in millions of dollars, and t is the year(assuming 1991 is  t=0). What does the 3.53 mean in the equation? (cited from)
A.The cost for maintaining crops was $3.53 million in 1991.
B.The cost for maintaining crops was $3.53 million in 2008.
C.The costs for maintaining crops increased a total of $3.53 million between 1991 and 2008.
D.The costs for maintaining crops increased by $3.53 million each year between 1991 and 2008.
Problem Analysis: This problem comes from KahnAcademy, its topic is Line Slope, its difficulty level is basic, its word verbalized level can be categorized as a deep word problem. However, in comparison to Problem4.1, this problems directly gives the math model in a forward manner, but asks students to explain its variable’s meaning in a backward manner.  It is a multiple-choice problem.
